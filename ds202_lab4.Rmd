```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(readxl)
defense <- read_excel('./cyclonesFootball2020.xlsx', sheet='Defensive')
offense <- read_excel('./cyclonesFootball2020.xlsx', sheet='Offensive')
biography <- read_excel('./cyclonesFootball2020.xlsx', sheet='Biography')
```

## Part 1: Cleaning Data

1. The player names and opponent names should be factors.
2. All offensive and defensive statistics should be numerical. The `Weight` column in biography should also be numberic. (Optional: Read `?across` and learn to mutate multiple columns simultaneously using the `across` function in `dplyr`)
3. The `Height` column in `biography` should be numeric. (Hint: Use a unit that works well)
4. Add a column to both `defense` and `offense` indicating whether it is the first or the second game versus an opponent. We had a single game versus each opponent except for Oklahoma, which we played against twice. (Hint: You can use `group_by()`, `mutate()`, and `row_number()`)
